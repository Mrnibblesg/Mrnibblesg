More to come in the future.  
Current project(s): A flow chart desktop app using the Windows API.

Other projects:
Chess website - A project from my Web Scripting class. The chess website implemented a fully functional chess website using a MERN stack, with socket.io added for real-time chess games. Users can create accounts, queue into matchmaking, and even spectate other games. 

Protein mutation visualization site - My senior project for CS that I worked on with two other team members. The protein mutation site aims to help researchers find protein mutants suitable to be subjects of research through visualization by various protein metrics.

Multi-platformer - An old multiplayer game I made prior to working on evades.io as a volunteer dev. I made it as a proof of concept that I could make stuff. It's a basic platformer where you can login and see other players currently in the world with you. It has basic movement mechanics like double jumping and wall jumping, and you would respawn if you fell off the edge. It was made utilizing the HTML \<canvas\> as well as socket.io, express, nginx, and a static ip service.
